# Attention-based-approach-for-designing-diffractive-gratings
Including all the data and the training code
This repository is designed to address the problem of predicting the diffraction efficiency of gratings. Three grating cases are provided for verification. The network and training code are not isolated, allowing direct modification of the data path for direct reproduction.
